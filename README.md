DPI Aware mouse move across screens

Allows accurate mouse screen crossover location within multi dpi monitors environment. It is typically useful when using a 4k monitor and a full HD side by side.

If people wants to participate with feedback or new ideas you're welcome. I really need beta testers now to provide a stable tool.
